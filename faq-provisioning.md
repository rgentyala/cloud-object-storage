# FAQ - Provisioning, Plans, and Naming
{: #faq-provision}

Frequently asked questions can produce helpful answers and insight into best practices for working with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

## Why can I not create or delete a service instance?
{: #faq-instance-create-delete}
{: faq}

A user is required to have have at a minimum the platform role of `editor` for all IAM enabled services, or at least for Cloud Object Service. For more information, see the [IAM documentation on roles](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions).


## Which one of my instances uses a Lite plan?
{: #faq-instance-find-lite}
{: faq}

An account is limited to a single instance of {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} that uses a Lite plan.  You can find this instance three different ways:

1. Navigate to the [catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/create) and attempt to make a new Lite instance.  An error will pop up prompting you to delete the existing instance, and provides a link to the current Lite instance.
2. Navigate to the storage section of the resource list, and click on any area of blank space to select an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}. An informational sidebar will appear and provide the plan name: either Lite or Standard.
3. Use the CLI to search for the resource:

```sh
ibmcloud resource search "service_name:cloud-object-storage AND 2fdf0c08-2d32-4f46-84b5-32e0c92fffd8"
```

## How do I upgrade a service instance from Lite to Standard?
{: #faq-instance-upgrade}
{: faq}

Typically, this is easily done from the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} console found here https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/, select the correct name of Cloud Object Storage Instance you wish to upgrade,click on **Plan** in the navigation menu, located after **Instance Usage**. Select the "standard" plan and hit save.

In cases where the instance has been locked due to exceeding the maximum allowed size of a Lite instance it may be necessary to use the CLI. The plan ID for a standard {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance is `744bfc56-d12c-4866-88d5-dac9139e0e5d` (if curious, this can be found by issuing the CLI command `ic catalog service cloud-object-storage`).  You'll need to know the name of the instance you are trying to upgrade.  For example, to upgrade the instance "My Object Storage", you can issue the command:

```sh
ibmcloud resource service-instance-update "My Object Storage" --service-plan-id 744bfc56-d12c-4866-88d5- dac9139e0e5d
## ic replaced with ibmcloud. "My Object Storage" is actually your instance that you had created on Cloud Object Storage. Instance Name or ID can be found from resource list, under storage section where you see your COS instance name. 
```

## Are bucket names case-sensitive?
{: #faq-name-case}
{: faq}

Bucket names are required to be DNS addressable and are not case-sensitive.

## What is the maximum number of characters that can be used in a key, or Object name?
{: #faq-max-key}
{: faq}

Keys have a 1024-character limit.

## What are some tools unable to render object names?
{: #faq-xml-error}
{: faq}

Object names that contain unicode characters that are not allowed by the XML standard will result in "Malformed XML" messages. For more information, see [the XML reference documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets).

## Can I create more than one Object Storage service with a Lite account?
{: #faq-lite-storage}
{: faq}
 
If you already have a Lite plan instance created, you may create other Standard plan instances, but only one Lite plan instance is allowed.

## What happens if I exceed the maximum usage allowed for a Lite plan?
{: #faq-lite-exceed}
{: faq}
 
Once you exceed the allowed usage, the service instance associated with the Lite plan becomes inaccessible.  You will receive a warning notification email with corrective steps. If you do not take action, the instance is removed.
